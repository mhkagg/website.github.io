                                            <p>Blessed with two beautiful rivers, Krishna and Godavari, Andhra Pradesh has the Bay of Bengal to its west, and it boasts of a coastline of 972km, the longest in the country. This state is widely advertised as the Kohinoor of India by the tourism department. The state is most visited for its world famous Tirupati temple. Srisailam Mallikarjuneswar temple is another famous Shiva shrine and is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga temples in India. In spite of the recent division of the state of Andhra Pradesh, which resulted in the formation Seemandhra which is what was left of Andhra Pradesh after Telangana region was carved out, Seemandhra seems to have got the better share regarding tourism.  </p>
